# 2-player-dice-game
A 2 player dice game I made as part of my Javascript study. I was following the lesson mostly but made sure to attempt each step using my own code and then refactor if neccessary. So my code is a little different from the example code. This is my second project using the little javascript I have learned to manipulate the DOM.
